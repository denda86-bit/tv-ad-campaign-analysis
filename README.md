# TV Campaign Impact on Web Traffic ðŸ“Š
This repository contains a data-driven analysis of how TV ad campaigns influence web traffic. Using Python, pandas, and machine learning techniques, the project identifies and quantifies the uplift in website visits attributed to TV spot airings.

Key Features:

âœ… Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) â€“ Cleaning, parsing timestamps, and visualizing trends in TV ad spots and traffic data.

âœ… Baseline Traffic Modeling â€“ Using tree-based regression (Gradient Boosting) to estimate organic traffic trends.

âœ… Attribution Analysis â€“ Measuring the uplift in visits caused by TV spots, factoring in seasonality, time-of-day effects, and other patterns.

âœ… Automated Time Series Processing â€“ Aggregation, feature engineering (weekdays, hours, seasons), and trend visualization.

âœ… Machine Learning for Prediction â€“ Training a model to establish expected traffic levels and identify deviations linked to TV airings.

âœ… Impact Visualization â€“ Graphing impressions over time to reveal ad effectiveness.

This project provides a reproducible framework for understanding how TV advertising influences digital engagement, helping optimize marketing strategies. ðŸš€ðŸ“ˆ
